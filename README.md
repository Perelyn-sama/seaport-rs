# Seaport-rs

I'm new to Rust and seek to be legendary at it, this project will be the first step.

The Goal is to replicate Seaport-js with Rust and to do that I'll have to implement the following functions:

- createOrder
- signOrder
- cancelOrder
- bulkCancelOrders
- validate
- getOrderStatus
- getCounter
- getOrderHash
- fulfilOrder
- fulfilOders
- matchOrders

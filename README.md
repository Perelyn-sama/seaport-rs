# Seaport-rs 

# WIP - WORK IN PROGRESS. REFER TO https://github.com/Alcibiades-Capital/quay FOR PRODUCTION READY CODE

I'm new to Rust and seek to be legendary at it, this project will be the first step.

The Goal is to replicate Seaport-js with Rust and to do that I'll have to implement the following functions:

-[ ] createOrder

-[ ] signOrder

-[x] cancelOrder

-[x] bulkCancelOrders

-[x] validate

-[x] getOrderStatus

-[x] getCounter

-[x] getOrderHash

-[x] fulfilOrder

-[x] fulfilOders

-[x] matchOrders
